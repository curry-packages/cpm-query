cpm-query
=========

This package contains the implementation of a tool to query
analysis information about entities (e.g., function, types, type classes)
defined in a module of some Curry package.

The tool is based and, therefore, requires the executable `curry-info`
to manage various Curry analysis tools.
`curry-info` can be installed as follows:

    > git clone https://github.com/curry-language/curry-info-system.git
    > cd curry-info-system
    > cypm install

To start the `cpm-query` tool:

    > cpm-query <module name> <function name>

or

    > cpm-query --type <module name> <type name>

or

    > cpm-query --class <module name> <class name>

Note that it is not necessary to invoke the tool inside a package
with `cypm exec` since the load path is automatically computed by this tool.
For instance, try (inside this package)

    > cpm-query Data.List split
    > cpm-query --class Prelude Ord
    > cpm-query System.Process exitWith
    > cpm-query System.Directory doesFileExist


Generating analysis information
-------------------------------

`cpm-query` can also be used to generate analysis information
with `curry-info`. For instance, the generation of analysis information
for all modules in package `base` in version `3.3.0` can be done by

    > cpm-query --generate base 3.3.0

This cleans all old information for this packages and generates
some default information for each class, type, and operation
for all modules of this package. To generate specific information
(i.e., requests supported by `curry-info`), one can use the `--request` option.
For instance, the documentation of all operations of package `process`
with version `3.0.0` can be generated by

    > cpm-query --generate --operation --request=documentation process 3.0.0

One can also add a module name to generate information for this module only.
For instance, the documentation of all prelude types can be generated by

    > cpm-query --generate base 3.3.0 Prelude --type --request=documentation

One can also put a list of package/version information
in a file (i.e., each line contains a package name and a version)
and provides this file as an option:

    > cpm-query --generate --from=FILE

If the file name is `-`, the package/version pairs will be read from
standard input.
